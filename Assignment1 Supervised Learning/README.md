# CS 7641 Assignment 1: Supervised Learning Classification<br>

This assignment is to implement and analyze 5 different classification algorithms for two datasets<br>
The datasets used are: Phishing Websites and Breast Cancer Wisconsin(Diagnostic)<br>
The classification algorithms are: Decision Tree, kNN, Neural Network, SVM and Boosting.<br>

Datasets:
Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)  -> https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic) <br>
                                      -> https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.data <br>
Phishing Websites -> https://www.openml.org/d/4534 <br>
<br>
<br>
Python Version: Python 2.7.15<br>
Packages used: scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, itertools, timeit<br>

Instructions to run the code:<br>
1. Work on the iPython notebook using Jupyter<br>
2. Run the python script.<br>

Before testing the code please make sure to install the necessary packages. Also make sure that the code and datasets are in the same folder.<br>
